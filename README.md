# Jenkins ETL Skeleton

This project provides a basic skeleton for building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using Jenkins. It is designed to help streamline the development and deployment of ETL workflows with Jenkins automation.

## Features

- Basic ETL pipeline structure
- Integration with Jenkins for automated execution
- Ability to customize pipeline steps according to your needs
- Flexible and scalable for various ETL tasks

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed and configured
- Python 3.x (or your preferred ETL scripting language)
- Required Python libraries (can be installed via `requirements.txt`)
- A Git repository for version control

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jenkins-etl-skeleton.git
cd jenkins-etl-skeleton
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

If your ETL uses Python, you can install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Jenkins

1. Configure a Jenkins job to run the ETL pipeline.
2. Set up your Jenkins pipeline script (`Jenkinsfile`) to trigger the ETL job.
3. Ensure that Jenkins has the necessary permissions to run the pipeline on your environment.

### 4. Customize the ETL Pipeline

Modify the pipeline files (e.g., `etl.py`) to match your specific ETL needs, such as:

- Data extraction from databases, APIs, or files
- Data transformation (e.g., cleaning, filtering, aggregation)
- Loading the transformed data into a database, cloud storage, or other systems

### 5. Run the Pipeline

You can trigger the ETL pipeline manually via Jenkins or schedule it based on your preferred frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).

## Customization

- Modify the pipeline steps in `Jenkinsfile` according to your Jenkins setup.
- Customize ETL scripts (`etl.py`) to connect to your data sources and destinations.
